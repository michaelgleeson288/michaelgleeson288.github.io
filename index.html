			<h2>Webpage experiments with styling</h2>
			<p>In here is the main body of my text. A full article, if you will. So far I'm enjoying doing HTML/CSS, to a point. I think I need to do more projects though. Weirdly I don't seem to like doing the text - as I'm doing now. In large part probably because I can just write text into a journal; it's NBD. And the type of content I put into a website is the type of stuff I already know (or have written elsehwere). In fact, websites are entirely other-facing. You don't browse your own website, mostly</p>
			<blockquote>Someone said something once, and now people remember it for some reason.</blockquote>
			<p>And while that does motivate me - making something that others will see - it also makes me wary. Because I don't have any content that I want other people to see! Nonetheless I guess I'll persist.</p>
